    <h2>Two projects</h2>
    <p>
      In over 14 years of programming I worked on a lot of projects. Here are two selected project that I liked most.

          <p>Streetfightz was a MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) for the browser that I started as side project with two friends during my studies.
            The story was simple but addictive; You are located in a city and have to look for other players to fight them. After the fight your skills get improved, you earn money and can buy or improve your house.</p>
          <h5>My part</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Project Management</li>
            <li>Invent story/algorithms</li>
            <li>Maintain community</li>
            <li>Build and extend PHP back-end</li>
            <li>Write front-end JavaScript code</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>What I learned</h5>
          <p>
            This was my first big project back in 2005 and although I had experiences in programming I had none in project management and working with colleges. I learned a lot about communication, what it needs to organize work of individuals.
            Also on the programming side was this project a big challenge for me. I never worked with such a complex system and large code base. I wrote my own MVC without knowing about that pattern in the first place, refactored a lot and tried to automate testing.
            <br/>Although I failed in various points I learned a lot about what Software Development really is.

          <p>local.ch is the swiss phone directory. Recently they switched their entire front-end to Ruby. It is one of the most visited websites in Switzerland.</p>
          <h5>My part</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Consulting (Ruby, API-Design, Testing)</li>
            <li>Front-end development</li>

          </ul>
          <h5>What I learned</h5>
          <p>
            I worked at local.ch as an additional programmer and consultant in front-end as well as in back-end.
            It was very interesting to see how a big company handles iterative development and how they manage a huge website like this with Ruby.
            We split up several parts in minimalistic Ruby projects (without Rails) and added some simplified layers to it to make the frontend code more readable and reliable.
            I was glad to be part of it and be able to help with my expertise in Ruby, Rails and testing.

    <h2>Fabio + Ruby = <span style="color:red;">&#9829;</span></h2>
    <p>Long story short: Here is the <a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></p>
    <h4>Chapter I: The adventure begins</h4>
    <p>
      My first programming experience was when I was 14 years old and participating in a programming course at our school.
      Though the teacher was an old school programmer and we worked on outdated computers with QBasic I got immediately hooked.
      In my free time I sat together with a friend and we started to write our own games. We worked on simple games like tick-tack-toe
      and wild text-adventures up to more sophisticated games with ASCII graphics and 8-bit music.
    </p>
    <h4>Chapter II: The road to the kingdom</h4>
    <p>
      Soon I realized that QBasic is very outdated and not the future. So I started to look into other languages
      like Java and VisualBasic. Somehow I could not get comfortable with Java and settled with Microsoft's VisualBasic.
      The syntax was very similar to what I already knew and the visual editor was very impressive. So I started to write
      Windows programs for the school (Yearbook photo application) and myself (notepad, chats, keygens, etc).
    </p>
    <h4>Chapter III: Arriving at the capital</h4>
    <p>
      And then I found my way to the future, the Internet...
      <br/>
      So I started to read some tutorials about HTML, CSS and PHP, wrote some Diablo II and Warcraft 3 fan pages and started
      my apprenticeship as a software engineer at one of the biggest retail stores in Switzerland. In school and at work I
      they used Java and so I learned for the first time a programming language without teaching myself.
      <br>
      Soon I exceeded the knowledge of my superior and teacher and got bored. Thanks to a lot of free time at work and
      projects at school I kept working with PHP and started to write a full browser game with the help of a graphic enthusiastic friend.
    </p>
    <h4>Chapter IV: Meeting the princess</h4>
    <p>In our computer science class at school we worked mostly on projects in small teams. There I met an other
    enthusiastic programmer and we ended up working mostly together. One day he told me about the new thing called Rails, a framework
    for web development based on the programming language Ruby.
    <br>At first a bit skeptical, after some time reading about it I tried it by implementing my first side project.</br>And I was immediately hooked...</p>
    <h4>Chapter V: Entering the castle</h4>
    <p>There was something magical happening. Several things I missed in other languages and frameworks where there: A readable syntax, a test framework that was actually usable,
    scaffolding, meta programming (<i>poof</i>, blew my mind), etc. A lot of concepts I've never heard before like TDD, REST and duck typing made a lot of sense to me.
    <br/>
    I kept working with Ruby and Rails for side projects but was bound to Java and ABAP at work. I tried to get more concepts from
    Rails into the other languages and environments but had to realize that it was not possible: The limits were set by the languages and how they
    restricted the developer.</p>
    <h4>Chapter V: The wedding</h4>
    <p>At one point I could not take it anymore. I felt like stuck in a prison. I quit my job, started my own software company
      and worked for several Ruby companies. I wouldn't change a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all lived happily ever after.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The end.
    </p>
    <h4><a name='tldr'></a>TL;DR: In short...</h4>
    <p>A friend introduced my to Rails in 2007 and I got hooked immediately by the concepts of the framework.
    <br/>Later I realized that the beauty and simplicity of Rails was heavily dependent of its language
    Ruby. These are the things that made me fall in love with Ruby and made me stick with it till now:
    <ul>
      <li>Human readable syntax</li>
      <li>Duck typing</li>
      <li>Meta programming</li>
      <li>Usable test framework</li>
      <li>Awesome community</li>
      <li>Matz</li>
